# Stroke Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of stroke in individuals based on a variety of health and demographic factors. The model leverages supervised learning techniques to make predictions that could potentially help in early diagnosis and prevention of strokes.

## Key Features
- *Data Preprocessing*: Handles missing values, transforms categorical data into numerical formats, and performs scaling.
- *Model Training*: Uses machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest to train models for stroke prediction.
- *Model Evaluation*: Assesses the model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- *Visualization*: Provides insights into the data and model performance through various visualizations using Jupyter notebooks.
