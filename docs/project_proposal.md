# Project Proposal: Stroke Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 1. Introduction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of stroke in individuals based on various health and demographic factors. The goal is to build a robust prediction system that can help in early diagnosis and prevention.

## 2. Objectives
- To preprocess and clean the given stroke dataset.
- To build and train machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression) for predicting strokes.
- To evaluate the models using various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- To deploy the model for making predictions on new data.

## 3. Key Deliverables
- A trained machine learning model capable of making stroke predictions.
- A well-documented codebase with clear instructions on how to run the model.
- Data exploration and analysis in Jupyter notebooks.
- Model evaluation results, including performance metrics and visualizations.

## 4. Timeline
- **Week 1**: Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.
- **Week 2**: Model building and training.
- **Week 3**: Model evaluation and tuning.
- **Week 4**: Documentation, testing, and deployment.
